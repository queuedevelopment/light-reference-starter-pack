# Light Reference — Starter Pack

A compact set of resources for teachers, students, and artists using **Light Reference**, the browser-based lighting studio.

## What’s inside
- **Presets** — a reference page with named setups and their slider settings (no import needed).
- **Worksheets** — a printable cheat sheet and **100 Lighting Study Prompts** (CSV).
- **Models** — Car OBj file that can be imported in the web app. Sphere, Cube and Cylindar are able to be added by default. 
- **Links** — one-page launcher with shortcuts to the web app and docs.

## Quick start
1. Open **links.html** and click **Open Light Reference**.
2. Pick a preset name from the app’s dropdown.
3. (Optional) Use the **models/** OBJs in your own 3D software or import into the app if supported.
4. Print the **worksheets/lighting-cheat-sheet.html** or open it in a browser/tab for class.
5. Pick a prompt from the CSV and start a timed study.

## Recommended use in class
- Demonstrate a preset (3‑point → rim → split) and discuss edge hierarchy.
- Let students adjust **key/fill/rim** and note how small changes affect read.
- Have pairs share setups using **Copy Link** and compare outcomes.
- Save frames with **Download PNG** for critique notes.
